History
---

Phoenity got started as [a decent theme](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=408&sid=c525eec45c28fa1f13a06ff00afcb6aa) for Firefox (formerly known as Firebird and Phoenix) on 4 November 2002. Initially, the Phoenity icons (now named as Phoenity Classic) are designed to be experimentally simple. Surprisingly, it became popular and ported to various other software.
